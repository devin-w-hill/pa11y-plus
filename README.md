# Pa11y README
Pa11y is a Node JS tool used to scan DOMs for ADA-compliance issues. It's name comes from the open-source project
on which it is based, [pa11y](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y). This tool extends that project with
more features and a proper framework for integration into a CI/CD pipeline.

## Note:
This is a "clean" version of an application written for specific business cases. Some of the code and 
explanations have been edited or removed to scrub the tool of any sensitive information. You will find
code that is not usable in its current state but can serve as a starting point to extend for your own
uses. Pa11y still functions as an ADA-compliance tool but is missing some features of the original.
